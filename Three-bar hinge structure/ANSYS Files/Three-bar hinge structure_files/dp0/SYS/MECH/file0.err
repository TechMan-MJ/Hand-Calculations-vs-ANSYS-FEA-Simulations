 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.156   TIME= 15:34:02
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.156   TIME= 15:34:02
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.156   TIME= 15:34:02
 Material number 8 (used by element 35) should normally have at least    
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.172   TIME= 15:34:02
 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70, degree of   
 freedom 1 of the element 38.  This may cause an ill-condition for the   
 solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary            
 conditions.

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70, degree of   
 freedom 3 of the element 38.  This may cause an ill-condition for the   
 solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70, degree of   
 freedom 4 of the element 38.  This may cause an ill-condition for the   
 solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary            
 conditions.

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70, degree of   
 freedom 5 of the element 38.  This may cause an ill-condition for the   
 solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary            
 conditions.

 An internal boundary condition has been imposed on node 70, degree of   
 freedom 6 of the element 38.  This may cause an ill-condition for the   
 solver.  Please check all MPC based elements having boundary            
 conditions.

 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
